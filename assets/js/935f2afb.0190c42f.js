Groups of densely connected nodes are easy to spot visually, but more sophisticated methods are needed to perform these tasks programmatically. Community detection algorithms are used to find such groups of densely connected components in various networks.","sidebar":"networkx_guide"},"algorithms/community-detection/girvan-newman":{"id":"algorithms/community-detection/girvan-newman","title":"Girvan-Newman algorithm","description":"The Girvan-Newman algorithm for the detection and analysis of community structure relies on the iterative elimination of edges that have the highest number of shortest paths between nodes passing through them. By removing edges from the graph one-by-one, the network breaks down into smaller pieces, so-called communities. The algorithm was introduced by Michelle Girvan and Mark Newman.","sidebar":"networkx_guide"},"algorithms/components/weakly-connected-components":{"id":"algorithms/components/weakly-connected-components","title":"Weakly connected components algorithm (Union find)","description":"A weakly connected component is a subgraph that is unreachable from other nodes/vertices of a graph or subgraph.

Galler and Michael J. in 1964 and specific implementations either utilize breadth-first search or depth-first search to find the graph components.","sidebar":"networkx_guide"},"algorithms/link-analysis/pagerank":{"id":"algorithms/link-analysis/pagerank","title":"PageRank algorithm","description":"Typing terms in Google and searching them up yields a lot of results.
